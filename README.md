# Factors Shaping Young Voter Demographics in the U.S.
Project Overview: This project analyzes the factors influencing voter turnout among young adults (ages 18-29) in the United States. Despite their potential to shape democracy, young voters have historically low turnout rates, making it crucial to understand the elements that drive or deter their participation.

*Research Question:* Which key factors have the highest impact on young voter turnout across the United States?

*Objectives:* 
1) Explore socio-demographic factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, education level, and household income, and their relationship with voter turnout.
2) Quantify the impact of these factors using statistical analysis techniques.
3) Identify which factors correlate most strongly with young voter turnout.
4) Recommend policy interventions and strategies to increase young voter engagement.
5) Data Exploration: We utilized a dataset with over 700 variables related to voter turnout, filtering for relevant socio-demographic and economic indicators. A sample of young adults (ages 19-29) was analyzed to understand their voting behavior.

*Key Findings:*
* Income: Higher individual household income correlates with increased voter turnout, while lower income relative to regional median values suggests lower turnout rates.
* Education: There is a clear positive trend between education level and voter turnout, with higher education associated with greater political engagement.
* Gender: Female voters exhibited higher turnout rates compared to male voters within the analyzed demographic.
* Ethnicity: Significant disparities in turnout rates were observed among different ethnic groups, indicating the need for tailored engagement strategies.
* Modeling: We employed logistic regression and Random Forest models to predict voter turnout, yielding insights into the most influential factors, including gender and socioeconomic status.

*Recommendations:* The findings suggest that targeted outreach and policy development addressing economic barriers, as well as tailored messaging for specific demographics, could enhance young voter engagement and participation.
